I want to set up new machines as quickly as possible, and as max env I can as possible.

I will have to write scripts, change and use different tools, automate steps and processes.

Use cloud file systems, switch to different code editors


1. All files on my pendrive / SSD
2. Copy all files over
3. A new mac setup script
